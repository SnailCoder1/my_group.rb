# my_group.rb

Here's a simple exercise for you to try what we have covered in this section:

Create an array and store it in a variable called my_group
Create three hashes describing an individual and name them person_1, person_2 and person_3. The hash should contain the following keys:
name
gender
age
Add all people to your my_group array.
Do everything in IRB but also save it in a .rb file called my_group.rb. We'll be returning to this example later on.
